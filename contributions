Brandon: Found they appropriate articles and pictures for the index page, linked them correctly. Designed the overall look of each page. Including the colours/locations of divs and other content to appropriate aesthetics standards.
Ronan: Researched events / dates / performers that are currently known about, added them to random performers for the sake of efficiency. Looked up ideas from other similar websites, including how to use forms, login pages.
Nathan:

We each communicated a lot to help eachother. If there was something one of us didn't know how to do, we were able to have a look and eventually work it out.
