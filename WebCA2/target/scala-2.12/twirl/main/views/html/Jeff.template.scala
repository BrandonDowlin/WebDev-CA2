                    <h3> Jeff Dunham </h3>
                    <h4>Performer Genre: Comedic Ventriloquist</h4>
                    <p>Jeffrey "Jeff" Dunham (born April 18, 1962) is an American ventriloquist and comedian 
                        who has also appeared on numerous television shows, including Late Show with David 
                        Letterman, Comedy Central Presents, The Tonight Show and Sonny With a Chance. He has 
                        six specials that run on Comedy Central: Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself, Jeff 
                        Dunham: Spark of Insanity, Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special, Jeff 
                        Dunham: Controlled Chaos, Jeff Dunham: Minding the Monsters, and Jeff Dunham: 
                        All Over the Map. Dunham also starred in The Jeff Dunham Show, a series on the 
                        network in 2009.</p>
                        <p>    
                        His style has been described as "a dressed-down, more digestible version of Don 
                        Rickles with multiple personality disorder". Describing his characters, 
                        Time magazine said, "All of them are politically incorrect, gratuitously 
                        insulting and ill tempered." Dunham has been credited with reviving 
                        ventriloquism, and doing more to promote the art form than anyone since 
                        Edgar Bergen.

                                Dunham has been called "America's favorite comedian" by Slate.com, and 
                                according to the concert industry publication Pollstar, he is the 
                                top-grossing standup act in North America, and is among the most successful 
                                acts in Europe as well. As of November 2009, he has sold over four million 
                                DVDs, an additional $7 million in merchandise sales, and received more 
                                than 350 million hits on YouTube as of October 2009 (his introduction of Achmed 
                                the Dead Terrorist in Spark of Insanity was ranked as the ninth most watched 
                                YouTube video at the time). A Very Special Christmas Special was the 
                                most-watched telecast in Comedy Central history, with its DVD selling over 
                                400,000 in its first two weeks. Forbes.com ranked Dunham as the third 
                                highest-paid comedian in the United States behind Jerry Seinfeld and Chris 
                                Rock, and reported that he was one of the highest-earning comics from 
                                June 2008 to June 2009, earning approximately $30 million during that period.
                                 Dunham also does occasional acting roles. He achieved the Guinness Book 
                                of World Records record for "Most tickets sold for a stand-up comedy tour" 
                                for his Spark of Insanity tour, performing in 386 venues worldwide.
