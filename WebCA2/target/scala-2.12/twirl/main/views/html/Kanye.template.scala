                    <h4>Performer Genre: Entrepeneur, Rapper</h4>
                    <p>Kanye Omari West (born June 8, 1977) is an American rapper, singer, 
                        songwriter, record producer, fashion designer, and entrepreneur. Born in Atlanta 
                        and raised in Chicago, West briefly attended art school before becoming known as 
                        a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing hit singles for 
                        artists such as Jay-Z and Alicia Keys. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, 
                        West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to widespread critical and 
                        commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music. He went on to pursue a 
                        variety of styles on subsequent albums Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), 
                        and 808s & Heartbreak (2008). In 2010, he released his fifth album My Beautiful Dark 
                        Twisted Fantasy to rave reviews from critics, and the following year he released the 
                        collaborative album Watch the Throne with Jay-Z. West released his abrasive sixth 
                        album, Yeezus, to further critical praise in 2013. His seventh album, The Life of 
                        Pablo, was released in 2016.
                            <p>
                            West's outspoken views and life outside of music have received significant 
                            mainstream attention. He has been a frequent source of controversy for his 
                            conduct at award shows, on social media, and in other public settings. 
                            His more scrutinized comments include his off-script denunciation of President 
                            George W. Bush during a live 2005 television broadcast for Hurricane 
                            Katrina relief and his interruption of singer Taylor Swift at the 2009 
                            MTV Video Music Awards. West's ventures as a fashion designer include 
                            collaborations with Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. on both clothing and 
                            footwear, and have most prominently resulted in the YEEZY collaboration 
                            with Adidas beginning in 2013. He is the founder and head of the creative 
                            content company DONDA. His 2014 marriage to television personality 
                            Kim Kardashian has also been subject to widespread media coverage.

                            West is among the most acclaimed musicians of the 21st century, 
                            and is one of the best-selling artists of all time, having sold more than 
                            32 million albums and 100 million digital downloads worldwide. He 
                            has won a total of 21 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most awarded 
                            artists of all time and the most Grammy-awarded artist to have debuted in 
                            the 21st century. Three of his albums have been included and ranked on 
                            Rolling Stone's 2012 update of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" list. 
                            He has also been included in a number of Forbes annual lists. Time named 
                            him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015.
