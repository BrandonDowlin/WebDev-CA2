                    <h3> Gorillaz </h3>
                    <h4>Performer Genre: Virtual Band</h4>
                    <p>Gorillaz are an English virtual band created in 1998 by musician Damon Albarn 
                        and artist Jamie Hewlett. The band consists of four animated members: 
                        2-D (lead vocals, keyboards), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle 
                        (guitar, keyboards) and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). These members 
                        are fictional and are not personas of any "real life" musicians involved in 
                        the project.[1] Their fictional universe is explored through the band's music 
                        videos, as well as a number of other short cartoons. In reality, Albarn is the 
                        only permanent musical contributor, and the music is often a collaboration between 
                        various musicians.
